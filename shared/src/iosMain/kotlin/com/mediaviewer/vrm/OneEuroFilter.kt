/**
 * VRM pipeline step 3 (see VrmModeScreen.kt's doc comment / the handoff's
 * "VRM: what's next" section): a One Euro Filter, applied to every raw
 * landmark coordinate / blendshape score before it goes anywhere near
 * retargeting (step 4+). Without this, per-frame MediaPipe jitter goes
 * straight onto the avatar's bones and reads as a constant tremor — this
 * is what step 6's retargeting will lean on to look stable instead.
 *
 * ## The algorithm
 * Casiez, Roussel & Vogel, "1€ Filter: A Simple Speed-based Low-pass Filter
 * for Noisy Input in Interactive Systems" (CHI 2012). The core idea: a
 * plain low-pass filter always trades responsiveness for smoothness. This
 * filter instead low-pass-filters the signal's *derivative* first, and
 * uses that (the estimated speed of movement) to pick a *bigger* cutoff —
 * i.e. less smoothing, less lag — when the signal is moving fast, and a
 * smaller cutoff — more smoothing — when it's nearly still. So a fast head
 * turn stays responsive, and a still face doesn't flicker from sensor
 * noise. That's the one thing a fixed-cutoff low-pass can't do.
 *
 * ## Tuning
 * - [minCutoff] — the cutoff (Hz) used when the signal isn't moving. Lower
 *   = smoother/laggier at rest. Start around 1.0 and lower it if a resting
 *   face/hand still looks jittery.
 * - [beta] — how much speed increases the cutoff. Higher = less lag during
 *   fast motion, but less smoothing during it too. Start at 0.0 (no speed
 *   adaptation, i.e. a plain fixed low-pass) and increase in small steps
 *   (0.007, 0.01, ...) only if fast motion feels laggy.
 * - [dCutoff] — cutoff used to smooth the derivative itself. 1.0 is the
 *   value the paper uses in essentially every example and rarely needs
 *   changing.
 * These three are exactly the three knobs the paper (and every
 * implementation of it, e.g. Apple's ARKit face tracking sample) exposes —
 * no others are needed.
 *
 * Not thread-safe and holds per-signal state (last value, last derivative,
 * last timestamp), so each independent scalar being smoothed — one face
 * blendshape, one landmark's X coordinate, one bone's rotation component —
 * needs its own instance. Use [OneEuroFilterBank] below rather than
 * managing instances by hand.
