            // only ever help. In practice, for *this* graph, it made things
            // dramatically worse. ConvNeXt interleaves depthwise Conv (an
            // NNAPI op) with LayerNorm and GELU (not NNAPI ops) in literally
            // every block — so NNAPI doesn't cleanly own "most of the graph"
            // or "none of it", it ends up claiming a huge number of *tiny*,
            // scattered single-op partitions threaded through dozens of
            // blocks. Every one of those partition boundaries is a hand-off
            // through Android's NNAPI HAL (real IPC/driver overhead, paid on
            // *every* inference, not just once at session creation) before
            // control returns to XNNPACK for the next unsupported op and
            // back again. That per-block round-trip overhead, multiplied by
            // however many blocks this ConvNeXt has, is a far more likely
            // explanation for 10-20s/image than fp32 conv math itself (which
            // XNNPACK alone handles in low single-digit seconds on this
            // class of phone) — and it matches known ORT/NNAPI guidance that
            // heavily-fragmented partitioning frequently loses to just not
            // using NNAPI at all. Dropping addNnapi() and letting XNNPACK
            // run the *entire* graph as one coherent optimized pass removes
            // that fragmentation overhead entirely.
            //
            // This is also, if anything, a small *accuracy* positive, not a
            // trade-off: NNAPI drivers are free to run the ops they accept
            // at reduced precision under the hood (a fp16 or even quantized
