/**
 * VRM pipeline step 1 (see VrmModeScreen.kt's doc comment): wraps MediaPipe's
 * FaceLandmarker in LIVE_STREAM mode, fed frames from VrmCameraTracking's
 * ImageAnalysis use case. Deliberately just the face landmarker for now, per
 * the handoff's build order — get this visibly working before adding
 * HandLandmarkerHelper / PoseLandmarkerHelper as siblings of this same
 * pattern.
 *
 * ## One piece of setup this file can't do for you
 * MediaPipe Tasks Vision loads its model from a `.task` file bundled as a
 * raw asset, not pulled in as a Maven artifact — it's a ~a few MB binary,
 * not source, and this sandbox has no network to fetch it. Before this
 * builds and actually detects anything:
 * 1. Download `face_landmarker.task` (float16 build is fine) from
 *    https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/latest/face_landmarker.task
 * 2. Place it at `app/src/main/assets/face_landmarker.task` — see the
 *    `.gitkeep`-style placeholder left in that folder.
 * Until it's there, [create] catches the load failure, logs why, and
 * returns null — the camera preview still runs, there's just no tracking
 * data to log yet.
 *
 * ## Unverified against the actual AAR
 * Written against the documented MediaPipe Tasks Vision API from memory,
 * with no way to compile-check it in this sandbox (no Android SDK/network
 * here — same constraint noted in HANDOFF.md). The class/package paths
 * below (`BaseOptions.Delegate`, `FaceLandmarker.FaceLandmarkerOptions`,
 * `ImageProcessingOptions`) are the ones documented for recent
 * `tasks-vision` releases, but if the pinned version in `build.gradle.kts`
 * disagrees, Android Studio's error will point at exactly which one moved.
