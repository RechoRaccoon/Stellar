/**
 * Bug fix: downloading a Bluesky video by saving the bytes at its HLS
 * `playlist.m3u8` URL under a `.mp4` filename produced a "video" that was
 * actually just a small text manifest — hence it showing up in the gallery
 * as 0 seconds long / corrupted.
 *
 * The real, original video file a person uploaded lives as a content-addressed
 * blob on *their own* PDS (Personal Data Server), referenced by the video
 * embed's `cid`. This resolves the correct PDS for a DID (most accounts are
 * NOT hosted on bsky.social itself) and builds the direct
 * `com.atproto.sync.getBlob` URL, which returns the real playable video.
